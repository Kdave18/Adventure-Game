# Adventure-Game

Welcome to the Adventure Game! This is a simple, text-based Python game where you make choices that determine the outcome of your adventure. Your decisions lead to different paths and endings. Will you survive or lose the game? It all depends on your choices!

## Features

- Simple text-based adventure game.
- Interactive choices that lead to different outcomes.
- Two main paths: left and right, each with its own set of decisions.
- Includes scenarios with walking around a river, swimming, crossing a bridge, and meeting a stranger.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script.
2. Enter your name when prompted.
3. Make choices by typing your answers (e.g., "left", "right", "swim", "walk", "head back", "cross", "yes", "no").
4. Depending on your decisions, you may win, lose, or encounter unexpected results.

## Code Overview

The game starts by greeting the player and asking them to choose a direction (left or right) at a fork in the road. Based on their choices, they will face different scenarios such as crossing a river, talking to a stranger, or heading back.

- If you choose **left**, you will encounter a river and must decide whether to walk around it or swim across.
- If you choose **right**, you will encounter a wobbly bridge and meet a stranger. You'll decide whether to cross the bridge or head back, and whether to talk to the stranger or not.

The game ends when the player either wins or loses based on their choices.
